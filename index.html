There will always be new languages, or processes, or technologies to learn. There will always be someone who knows something you don’t. There will always be someone who knows more than you do. There will always be someone who’s a better developer.</p>

They have a deep need to be perfect at everything and to be perfect immediately. Because these people view their intelligence as fixed, failures are a reflection of their lack of intelligence and so they seek to blame circumstances or other people for their failures.</p>

                                Programming often gives the newcomer a feeling of control they’ve never experienced before in their life. It can be a heady rush, but the reasonable among us wake up to realise that the problems we have to solve are much more complex than the simple techniques we’ve learned so far and that we are not masters of the universe. Sadly, a large number of people never do reach that level of awareness, remaining convinced that they now know the answer to everything - and so they never really learn another thing for the rest of their careers.

                            <p>
                                UI developer <a href="">Caryn Farvour</a> Caryn Farvour notes that high achievers tend to experience imposter syndrome more often and more acutely. It doesn’t matter how much objective data there is to prove that someone deserves their position and success—deep down, that person can still believe themself to be a fraud. That’s exactly why, in the case of coding bootcamps, someone might be accepted to a competitive coding bootcamp, excel in the program, and even land a great job, but still not feel “good enough.”

                                Imposter syndrome doesn’t discriminate; it doesn’t care how high on the ladder you ascend. Legendary Mozilla programmer <a href="https://davidwalsh.name/impostor-syndrome" target="_blank">David Walsh </a> David Walsh  still believes he is an imposter—even to this day. The industry is a huge part of the problem, says Walsh. He points out that as a web developer, you are competing with anyone with a laptop, anywhere in the world. Your efficiency as a programmer is measurable, too; you can see how much better someone else’s solution is. To make matters worse, programming languages, frameworks, and APIs can become redundant overnight, so you have to keep up with trends, or risk seeming out of touch and less valuable as an employee.

                                Ironically, imposter syndrome is most likely to strike right at the point when you achieve success, says developer <a href="https://medium.com/@kerisavoca/what-if-its-not-imposter-syndrome-a7c06c9ed3c0" target="_blank">Keri Savoca</a> . She describes imposter syndrome as a “defense mechanism”—albeit a misguided one that ultimately hurts us—that kicks in because we are averse to giving ourselves credit for our achievements, even though we’d likely praise someone else for achieving the exact same thing. Those who experience imposter syndrome are very quick to be hard on themselves, yet would never treat others the same way. So how can you unlearn these negative thought patterns and start giving yourself the benefit of the doubt?
